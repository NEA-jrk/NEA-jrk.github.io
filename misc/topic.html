			<!-- Main content -->
			<center><p style="font-family:times new roman"> 
				The application of robotics has led to significant advancements in the field of medicine and healthcare. <br>
				Robotic surgery, where specifically designed robots assist in complex surgeries aims to increase patient safety and quality of life (Diana, Marescaux, 2015) 
				through precision only achievable by machinery (Robotic surgery, 2022).  <br><BR>
				Defined as <I style="font-family:times new roman">surgery which uses specialized technology to enhance a surgeon’s capabilities </I>(Robotic surgery, 2022),
				it is no surprise that robotic surgery is referred to as “the single greatest surgical innovation of the past three decades.” (Diana, 2015). <br>
				<br>In a society with a growing demand for minimally invasive surgery (MIS), robotic surgery not only is efficient but allows surgeons to explore and attempt surgeries thought impossible before. <center>

	* Shorter hospitalisation: reduced/no loss in blood transfusions. 
	<br>
	*It can also reduce the amount of blood transfusions required, minimal scarring (MIS) 
	<br>
	<br>
	The minimally invasive approach used in robotic procedures typically results in less blood loss compared to open surgeries. The robotic system provides enhanced precision and dexterity to the surgeon, allowing for more precise movements and better control, which can help minimize bleeding during the procedure. Consequently, patients undergoing robotic-assisted surgery may have a lower likelihood of requiring blood transfusions.

	“It basically is allowing us to shrink down the size of our hands,” says Erik Dunki-Jacobs, MD, a surgeon at the TriHealth Robotic Center of Excellence. He uses robotic surgery to remove tumours from parts of the body that typically would have been hard to reach, requiring large incisions. The surgical system takes the natural tremor out of the surgeon’s hands, and the 3D camera that is inserted along with the surgical instruments gives them 10x better vision.

	*Reduced pain and discomfort 
	<br>
	Robotic surgical systems provide surgeons with enhanced precision and control. The robotic arms used in the surgery allow for precise and steady movements, minimizing tissue damage and reducing the risk of accidental injury to surrounding structures. 
	<br>
	<br>
	*Much higher success rate of 95% compared to without: enhanced precision, flexibility and control, better views of operation site 
	<br>
	This is because robots have an improved visualization. Robotic surgery provides surgeons with a three-dimensional, high-definition view of the surgical site. The robotic system often includes a magnified camera that provides a detailed and magnified view of the operating field. This enhanced visualization allows surgeons to see intricate details more clearly, enabling them to make precise surgical manoeuvres and improve overall accuracy during the procedure.

	*Field has potential to grow 
	<br>
	Robotic surgery has already made significant advancements in recent years and has gained widespread adoption in various surgical specialties. However, there is still room for further growth and development in several aspects like technological advancements, expanding applications, increased surgeon expertise, patient demand, and improved cost-effectiveness. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The positive aspects of robotic surgery are that it allows surgeons to operate in difficult to reach spaces such as deep in the pelvis or under the diaphragm. Because the arms of the robot allow flexion and extension in ways that laparoscopic instruments are not capable of, the robot allows surgeons to have the equivalent of wrists on the instruments when placing stitches or dissecting. The robot has all the advantages of laparoscopic surgery such as small incisions and fast healing time. Another important advantage of the robot is the ergonomics of the operating surgeon. Instead of standing next to the patient in an uncomfortable position, the surgeon now spends the entire time sitting down with the back and neck straight. Because the robot can translate any gentle movement into a strong grip, the surgeon’s arms do not tire out from having to use their own strength to retract tissue. Most importantly, the robot does not operate on the patient; the surgeon does. The robot does not have a mind of its own, and every move it makes is under the control of the surgeon. In a way, the robot is simply an extension of the surgeon’s arms.
